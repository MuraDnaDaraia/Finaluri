                Kruspe was born Sven Kruspe in Wittenberge, East Germany. He changed his first name to Richard, believing in the right to change one's identity. His parents divorced early, and he had a challenging relationship with his stepfather. Kruspe took up wrestling for seven years during his youth.
                
                At 16, a trip to Czechoslovakia led him to buy a guitar, which inspired him to learn to play. He later studied jazz guitar at the conservatorium in Schwerin.
                
                Kruspe moved to East Berlin in the late 1980s. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, he returned to Schwerin and founded several bands, including Das Elegante Chaos and Orgasm Death Gimmick. In 1993, he started a project called Tempelprayers with Oliver Riedel and Christoph Schneider. They later formed Rammstein with Till Lindemann, Paul Landers, and Christian Lorenz, winning a Berlin Senate Metrobeat contest in 1994
                
                Kruspe has three children. He married South African actress Caron Bernstein in 1999 and moved to New York in 2001. They separated in 2004, and he returned to Berlin in 2011.
                
                Kruspe has endorsed ESP Guitars since 1996 and primarily uses their models. He has his own signature models, the ESP RZK-I and RZK-II. He also uses Mesa/Boogie amplifiers, Kemper Profiler, and has a signature pickup set with Fishman.</p>

            <p>Christian "Flake" Lorenz, born on 16 February 1966, is a German musician best known as the keyboardist and a main composer for the Neue Deutsche H채rte band Rammstein. He was previously a member of the East German punk band Feeling B from 1983-1994, during which time he and bandmate Paul Landers supplemented their income by selling homemade jackets on the black market.
